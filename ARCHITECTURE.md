# Multi-Tenant School Management SaaS Architecture

## Overview
Transform NewHoly into a scalable SaaS platform where multiple schools can be managed from a single super admin panel.

## Database Schema Design

### Organizations Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  organizationId: "newholy_school", // unique slug
  name: "New Holy Cross School",
  domain: "newholy.schoolsaas.com", // custom subdomain
  settings: {
    theme: "blue",
    logo: "path/to/logo",
    contact: {...},
    address: {...}
  },
  subscription: {
    plan: "premium", // basic, premium, enterprise
    status: "active",
    expiresAt: Date,
    features: ["gallery", "events", "admissions"]
  },
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Users Collection (Enhanced)
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  username: "admin@newholy.com",
  email: "admin@newholy.com",
  password: "hashed_password",
  role: "school_admin", // super_admin, school_admin, staff
  organizationId: "newholy_school", // null for super_admin
  permissions: ["manage_students", "manage_content"],
  profile: {
    name: "John Doe",
    phone: "+977-xxx-xxx"
  },
  isActive: true,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Modified Collections (Add organizationId to all)
All existing collections get an `organizationId` field:
```javascript
// students, programs, contacts, news_events, etc.
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  organizationId: "newholy_school", // NEW FIELD
  // ... existing fields
}
```
